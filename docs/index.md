#The Pneuron Distributed Platform 
Pneuron’s Distributed Platform is composed of a series of purpose-built Pneurons™ (i.e. retrieve, analyze, derive, present) visually configured through the Design Studio™ and assembled into processing networks. Scheduling and execution of each Pneuron and network is controlled by the Cortex™, with results visualized and manipulated in the Enterprise Control Manager™.

##[Pneurons](DesignStudio/PneuronDescriptions)
Distributed, lightweight, fixed-function, interoperable processing components that non-invasively connect to individual source systems to create a powerful processing network that sidesteps today’s time and cost penalties.

##[Design Studio (DS)](DesignStudio/DesignStudioGuide)
Enables design, development, integration, deployment,
and network management from a single visual and intuitive user interface.

##[Enterprise Control Manager (ECM)](EnterpriseControlManager/EnterpriseControlManagerGuide)
Comprehensive suite of intelligence visualization
tools that provide interactive ability to perform
what-if analysis and recast results instantaneously.

##[Pneuron Administration](Administration/AdministrationGuide)
Comprehensive administration tool provides oversight and management of core platform, including deployment, operations, change management, user privileges, and data security.

##[Pneuron Cortex](PneuronArchitecture/PneuronArchitecture)
Encapsulates multiple technologies into a lightweight, dynamic run-time server that provides enterprise-class
scale, availability and resiliency while re-using existing infrastructure or leveraging dedicated capacity.
