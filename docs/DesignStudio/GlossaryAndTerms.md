#Glossary and Terms

| Name | Definition |
|--|--|
| Canvas | The main window of the Pneuron Design Studio application in which you create networks and configure and connect Pneurons. Pneurons are dragged onto the canvas from the palette. |
| Cluster Network | A set of Pneurons defined to execute a particular workflow, including multiple instances of those Pneurons to provide parallel processing for high throughput, and redundancy for high availability. An engine for processing injected messages (i.e. Units of Work) via Java Message Service (JMS) that are transmitted via web services. Clustered networks enable you to uniquely configure an application for specific processing control, such as load balancing, application work distribution, and processing. Configuring applications at the cluster level enables you to tailor the processing model to each application and its cluster. A cluster network comprises two different types of nodes: Dispatcher and Worker. In a typical cluster network, there are two Dispatcher Pneurons and two or more worker nodes. |
| Dispatcher Node | A node running a Dispatcher Pneuron within a cluster. The dispatcher distributes messages to worker nodes. |
| ECM | See “Pneuron Enterprise Control Manager.” |
| HUD | Heads Up Display. A Pneuron™ within the Pneuron Design Studio application that produces a small, non-intrusive alerts window that floats on top of any screen. The HUD window provides immediate feedback on a function within a network. It shows relevant real-time alerts and event information, workflows, and analysis from other systems and third party applications within an organization. HUD provides a function overlay for legacy and third party applications. |
| Master Dispatcher | A Dispatcher node within a cluster that controls the cluster, including distribution of messages to particular worker nodes. At any moment, only one dispatcher node is designated as the master dispatcher. A cluster cannot perform any work without a master dispatcher. If multiple dispatcher nodes are defined for a single cluster, they negotiate amongst themselves to select one to act as master. |
| Network | A group of Pneurons in the Pneuron Design Studio application that are connected together to fulfill a particular business solution. Networks comprise a project. |
| Node | A machine running the Pneuron server and particular Pneurons. |
| Palette | The bottom area of the Pneuron Design Studio screen that contains rows of Pneurons, which can be dragged onto the canvas for configuration. |
| Permanent Node | A node within a cluster that is not automatically started and stopped by the Pneuron software. |
| Pneuron | A mini-application within Pneuron Design Studio that runs a specific set of actions. |
| Pneuron Administration | A Pneuron proprietary web application used to configure user permissions, roles, module access and data source access as well as participating hosts and realms. |
| Pneuron Design Studio | A Pneuron web application used to create Pneuron networks. Design Studio allows a user to configure Pneurons, data sources, variables, queries, data acquisition, business rules, intelligence analytics, and more. |
| Pneuron Enterprise Control Manager (ECM) | A Pneuron web application used to view the generated data analyses based on the configurations within Pneuron Design Studio and Pneuron Administration. Results are displayed via bars, graphs, and charts related to query output. You can modify conditional/user defined variables and visualize the changes in business value drivers in real time. ECM also enables you to interact directly with networks in Pneuron Design Studio. |
| Project | A group of Pneuron networks. You can have multiple networks within a project. |
| Realm | The collection of dispatcher and worker nodes associated with a cluster. A cluster can be defined with or without a realm. A realm only needs to be defined if the Pneuron server is required to start and stop nodes automatically. In the Pneuron software, the term "realm" refers to the Pneuron server's ability to start and stop virtual machines (VMs), incorporating them into the distributed working environment. Typically, new VMs are added when system load is heavier, in order to maintain high throughput, and are removed when system load is lighter, in order to reduce operating costs. The concept of realms is associated with the concept of clusters, but clusters do not necessarily include any VMs. It is possible to have a Pneuron cluster where all of the worker nodes operate continuously, regardless of system load. |
| Realm Action Request | One of three values that provide manual override of the Pneuron server's algorithm for starting and stopping transient worker nodes, regardless of other factors such as system load that may be influencing the algorithm. The action request field for each node is one of these three values: NULL (meaning manual override), STOP (meaning stop the node), or START (meaning start the node). As soon as a non-null action request is processed, it is automatically reset to NULL. |
| Realm Existence | One of two values that define the state of existence of the node within a cluster: "PERMANENT" or "TRANSIENT". The Pneuron software does not start and stop permanent nodes automatically, only transient nodes. |
| Realm Name | A unique identifier for the realm. Each cluster that identifies a realm must specify a different realm name. |
| Realm Node Role | One of two values that define the role of the node within a cluster, "DISPATCHER" or "WORKER". The Pneuron software does not start and stop dispatcher nodes automatically, only worker nodes. |
| Slave Dispatcher | A hot standby dispatcher node within a cluster that tracks the same data as the current master dispatcher, but is not executing any of the work. If the master dispatcher becomes inoperative, the slave dispatchers negotiate amongst themselves to select one to act as the new master. A cluster can be defined, and can operate, with no slave dispatchers, in which case, the cluster stops performing any work if the master dispatcher becomes inoperative. |
| Subnet | A set of Pneurons working on a single worker node. Each subnet is capable of executing the entire workflow. All subnets within a cluster must have the identical set of identically connected and configured Pneurons, except that each subnet runs on a different worker node. |
| Transient Node | A node within a cluster that can be automatically started and stopped by the Pneuron software. (The Pneuron software does not, however, start and stop transient dispatcher nodes, only transient worker nodes.) Typically, a transient node is a virtual machine running on a host server. |
| VM | Virtual Machine. |
| VM Realm | A group of nodes. |
| .war | Web Application Archive. A type of ZIP file containing the deployment components of a Java web application, so that it can be deployed to and run on a Java servlet engine (Tomcat) or a JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) application server (WebSphere, JBoss, etc.). |
| Widget | The various bars, graphs, and charts displayed in the Enterprise Control Manager (ECM). |
| Worker Node | A node within a cluster that runs Pneurons. The dispatcher sends messages to the worker nodes based on how the workflow is defined for the cluster. |
| Workflow | A series of steps to be performed for a particular type of transaction. |
